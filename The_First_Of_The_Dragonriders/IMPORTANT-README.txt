INSTRUCTIONS-HOW TO INSTALL THIS WONDERFUL, YET UNBALANCED, CAMPAIGN:

1. AFTER UNZIPPING THE FOLDER, PLACE IT IN {your_hard_drive}:\Program Files\Wesnoth 1.4.x\data\campaigns. IT WON'T BE WORKING IN "Userdata/etc/etc".
2. TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMAGES AND THE OTHER STUFF.
3. OPEN WESNOTH 1.4.X AND PRESS THE "CAMPAIGNS" BUTTON. IT SHOULD BE THERE, SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.
4. ENJOY!!
5. IF PROBLEMS OCCUR DURING ENJOYING, PLEASE CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER.
6. THANK YOU.
7. ANY COMMENTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.
8. NOTE: THIS CAMPAIGN WAS LARGELY CREATED BY HACKING MAINLINE CAMPAIGNS AND SCENARIOS. I ASK THE RESPECTIVE CREATORS TO SHOW MERCY.
9. DUE TO LACK OF TIME, I HAVEN'T COMPLETE ANIMATIONS. ANY CONTRIBUTION ACCEPTED. IN FACT ALL IMAGES ARE EITHER STOLEN OR CREATED WITH MS PAINT. DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH...
10. I FEEL SORRY TO INFORM LINUX USERS AS WELL AS MAC (IN SHORT ANYBODY NOT USING WINDOWS) THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS CURRENTLY ONLY WORKING PROPERLY IN WINDOWS.

P.S.: AS THERE ARE NO CREDITS IN THE SCENARIO FILES, HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO KNOW WHO BUILT THIS CAMPAIGN: ME, WITH A SLIGHT LITTLE HELP FROM COUSINS AND BROTHERS WISHING TO DO SOME PAINT-WORK. AND CLAIMING TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED MANY IDEAS (NO COMMENT ON THIS).
